# CLI Tests

This directory contains tests for command-line interface functionality.

## Files

- `test_cli_*.py` - CLI argument validation and live API integration
- `test_all_filters_cli.py` - Filter integration testing via CLI

## Purpose

CLI tests ensure that command-line arguments are properly parsed, validated, and that the CLI interface correctly integrates with the underlying functionality.
